To center the text within the .textlayer element using flexbox, you can use the following CSS code:

.textlayer {
  font-weight: 900;
  font-size: 28px;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center; /* add this line */
}

By adding the align-items: center property to the .textlayer class, it will vertically center the text within the container. This ensures that the text is both horizontally and vertically centered.
